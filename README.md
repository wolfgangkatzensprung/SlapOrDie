This is a funny arena brawler for 1â€“4 players, playable locally on the same screen or via LAN (or both). The central question here is: To slap or be slapped?

This student project was made with Unreal 5.5 in 10 weeks and released to [itch.io](https://s4g.itch.io/slap-or-die) in February 2025. We plan to release it on Steam as well.
