![aD5I3U](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/371614e4-9078-4a3a-bde6-fb5ab3244e24)

This is a funny arena brawler for 1â€“4 players, playable locally on the same screen or via LAN (or both). The central question here is: To slap or be slapped?

This student project was made in 10 weeks and released to [itch.io](https://s4g.itch.io/slap-or-die) in February 2025. We plan to release it on Steam as well.
